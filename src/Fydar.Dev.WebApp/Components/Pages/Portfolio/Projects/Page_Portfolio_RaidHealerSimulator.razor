                <p>As a part of Ludum Dare, I submitted my game to the <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/$195962" target="_blank">project Ludum Dare page<SvgSprite Link="/icons.svg?v=1#icon-external-link" class="external-link-icon" /></a> for feedback. The community was incredibly supportive of the project.</p>

                <p>Below is a summary of the user feedback left on the project page.</p>

                <h3>Positives</h3>

                    <li><b>Accurate representation of healing:</b> Many players commented that the game accurately captured the experience of healing in an MMO, including the stress, communication with teammates, and difficulty.</li>
                    <li><b>Good use of theme:</b> Players appreciated the intro sequence and chat mechanics that added to the MMO feel.</li>
                    <li><b>Concept and humour:</b> The core idea of the game was well-received, and the chat messages provided humour for many users.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Negatives</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Difficulty:</b> The game was considered too difficult by many players, especially for those unfamiliar with MMOs.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of in-game explanations:</b> Players found it hard to understand what abilities did due to the lack of tooltips or in-game explanations.</li>
                    <li><b>Visual feedback:</b> Some players wished for more visual feedback on the effects of their spells.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Suggestions</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Include in-game ability explanations:</b> Tooltips or a tutorial could explain what each ability does.</li>
                    <li><b>Lower difficulty curve:</b> Consider easing players into the game by slowly introducing mechanics.</li>
                    <li><b>Improve visual feedback:</b> Show the effects of spells more clearly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Overall</h3>

                <p>Despite some difficulty issues, the game was well-received for its humour, accurate representation of healing, and good use of the theme.</p>
